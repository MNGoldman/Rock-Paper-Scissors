# Rock-Paper-Scissors

A Rock-Paper-Scissors app created by myself to practice and demonstrate some of my current JS, CSS, and general Web Developer abilities.

This project was 100% coded by myself, with minimal help from the internet. The idea for this app was presented to me from the Odin project. I thought it sounded fun, but wanted to polish it as much as possible to demonstate my currrent skills. Normally I would opt for simplicity for a simple app like this, but again this is for demonstrative purposes.
